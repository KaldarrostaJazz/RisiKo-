# A RisiKo! stochastic simulator.

A program that computes RisiKo! statistics.

RisiKo! is an italian strategic board game very similar to the American
Risk!, with the main difference being that the difender can use up to
three dice.

This program runs a Monte Carlo simulation of various attacks, with the 
aim of computing the probability of success and the average number of
troops lost during the assault.

The data obtained are plotted on graphs and tables, which can be used
as support during the games. Feel free to look and interpret them as you
want. I think they can be useful to aknowledge how important and
impactant chance is in the system of rules used. By realizing this, and
by using this tables in-game, a player will play more strategicly and
the game itself will become more startegic.
